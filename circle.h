//?? How is the following called?
#ifndef CIRCLE_H //What does this do? What purpose might it have?
#define CIRCLE_H //?

//!The following is called a forward declaration!
//!With forward declarations functions and classes are defined BEFORE they are implemented

float area(float radius); //What did we do here?

//??Why do we use forward declaration?
//??What might be the reason why it is absolutely necessary in C++? Keep in mind that C++ has classes that inherit something

#endif //CIRCLE_H
